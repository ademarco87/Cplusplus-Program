# Cplusplus-Program


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    Airgead investment calculator from SNHU CS-210 C++ project. It takes user input and outputs a value dollar based on time. It is created in C++ and uses functions and classes and outputs a nice format from the user input of initial investment amount


What did you do particularly well?
    Calculator performs as intended per the project rubric. It outputs a nice format which is easily readable by the user. Code is split into 3 files, asking for input from the user. User can only input certain values and will loop until the correct format is input. This keeps the calculator from making egregous errors.
    
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I could improve the code by seperating input validation, interest calculations and the balance calculation into smaller files for easier readability. Error handling can be improved to help user understand what went wrong, or why it errored.
    
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I found that the float-point precision as being the most difficult in this. I keep handy the manual to a language for when I forget how to do certain things, such as the float point precision. 
    
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    Programming fundimentals is essential for any language. I have found myself working on other language projects and using the wrong language. Synaxt matters. For this particular project, this involves problem solving in a financial way. While not being a master in finances, I understand the basis of how this works and can consult with a financial manager for accuracy during testing phase.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I broke this down into modular design and each have a clear and distinct purpose. This makes the code easy to understand and can be modified as needed without changing the overall design. The input validation ensures the user input is checked for propure usage - to minimize calculation errors and output. The overall output provides a clear and informative message back to the user peramiters. Documentation within the code also helps explain the purpose of each function.
